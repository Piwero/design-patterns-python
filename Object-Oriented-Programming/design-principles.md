# Design Principles

## Encapsulate what varies
It's a design principle that suggests isolating changing parts of a system within different objects or classes. This supports flexible design and reduces coupling between components. 
It allows changes to be kept within encapsulated components, without changing other parts of the system. 
This principle encourages code reusability, keeps system structure, and supports high cohesion and loose coupling, leading to more robust and scalable applications.

## Loosely coupled
Two loosely coupled objects means that they can interact but they have little knowledge of each other. This offers a lot of flexibility. Design patterns examples include the observer pattern.
Loosely coupled designs permit us to build flexible OO applications that can be easily changed because they minimise the interdependency between objects.
