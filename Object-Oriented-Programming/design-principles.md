# Design Principles

## Loosely coupled
Two loosely coupled objects means that they can interact but they have little knowledge of each other. This offers a lot of flexibility. Design patterns examples include the observer pattern.
Loosely coupled designs permit us to build flexible OO applications that can be easily changed because they minimise the interdependency between objects.
